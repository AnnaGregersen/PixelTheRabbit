Hello there, I'm Hare Hunter or Anna. I'm a super cool programmer.

I have studied in programming since I was 10 years old with Scratch and Youtube Roblox Lua tutorials. Although, I am currently learning Python and Lua-C. I am also learning Cybersecurity in Cyberpatriot. My Highschool Open-bracket team was a gold-tier state contestant in my Junior year of Highschool under my leadership. In my freshman year, I took two years worth of programming for game development (C#, Unity) within one year due to my speed in which I flew through the course material.

I look to expand and develop my skills further in anything programming that I can. I love computers and they are genuinely my favorite thing.

Programming Languages that I feel that I have mastered:
* Lua
* Java
* Python
* HTML/CSS
* C#

Have a good day and stay safe!
